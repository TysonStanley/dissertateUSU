# The Problem

The health and prevention sciences are increasingly interested in how one variable affects another. For example, research suggests that chronic illness in adolescence can lead to poor health and behavioral outcomes [@Pinquart2011]. But the question remains, how does this affect take place? Answering this question is not only intellectually interesting but it can provide more meaningful avenues of intervention. For this example, it may be important to understand whether chronic illness leads to poor mental health which then impacts health and behavior. The tool of choice in investigating these types of questions is *mediation analysis*.

Mediation analysis is a widely used technique that allows researchers to investigate *how* one variable may affect another through an intermediate variable. Fields that seek malleable targets of intervention [e.g., the prevention sciences; @Coie1993] find mediation analysis to be an indepensible tool for it allows researchers to evaluate the processes or pathways of an effect---of interventions, risk-factors, and protective-factors alike [@Fairchild2009; @Hayes2009; @MacKinnon2007; @Iacobucci2008book; @mackinnon2008intro; @Shrout2002]. It uses predictors, mediators, and outcomes within a single conceptual model where "the independent [predictor] variable influences the mediator, which in turn exerts an influence on the dependent [outcome] variable," [@Serang2017, pg. 1]. Thus, it provides an approach to understand the potential process(es) underlying an effect between a predictor and an outcome.

But, as it currently stands, mediation analysis is highly restricted to be used with certain types of data in certain situations. Specifically, when the hypothesized mediator and/or outcome is categorical or otherwise non-normal (e.g., binary, count, multinomial) current approaches are difficult to apply, are restricted to only a few useful cases, and are even more difficult to interpet. If the goal of the health and prevention sciences is to communicate important findings to impact policy, intervention, behavior, and future research, both utility (the number of situations wherein it can be used) and interpretability (how easily the results can be understood and applied) are key. Without these, results can be misunderstood and miscontrued, leading to false beliefs and ineffective interventions.

This project is designed to alleviate this issue through the synthesis of two established methods, in effect creating a new framework for mediation analysis that comfortably integrates previous work. Before establishing this new interpretable framework, mediation analysis is discussed, highlighting its strengths and current weaknesses.


# Mediation Analysis

Mediation analysis, as built on linear regression [@Hayes2009; @Edwards2007], combines two or more regression models to estimate the full conceptual mediation model. It is sometimes referred to as *Conditional Process Analysis* when combined with moderation [i.e., interaction effects; @Hayes2013book] and is often portrayed via path diagrams and directed acyclic graphs. Confirmatory analysis within mediation is well established for a variety of situations [e.g., @Lockhart2011] while exploratory analysis is beginning to take shape [@Serang2017]. Confirmatory mediation has been applied often in health behavior research---showing pathways leading to health-risk behavior such as drug use [@Lockhart2017; @Luk2010; @Shih2010; @Wang2009], tobacco use [@Ennett2001], and alcohol use [@Catanzaro2004]. 

Knowing the pathway of effect allows clinicians, interventionists and policymakers to target modifiable parts of the pathway. For example, there is evidence that bully victimization in adolescence increases depression, which subsequently increases drug use [@Luk2010]. In this example, assuming no confounding, there are at least two immediate targets of intervention: the victimization and the depression. Interventions based on a model without the mediator will be incomplete and may fail to alleviate the risk-factor(s). Further, without the mediating effect included in the model, we are at risk of confounding, causing our estimates to be misleading.

In its simplest form, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:simplemed}, X is the predictor, M is the mediator (intermediate variable), and Y is the outcome. The paths labeled $a$ and $b$ make up the mediated effect (i.e., "indirect" effect) of X on Y whereas path $c'$ is the direct effect of X on Y [@Hayes2009]. The total effect is equal to $a \times b + c'$, which in linear models, should equal the $c$ estimate in the simple regression of $Y = c_0 + cX + error$. It is important to note that mediation analysis can become much more complex than that in the figure. Covariates and moderation can be added to the model as well, potentially for a more causal interpretation [@Small2013; @Hayes2013book].

\end{figure}

## Definitions

Before discussing mediation further, it is helpful to note some terminology that are often used in the field. In Figure \ref{fig:simplemed}, X is a predictor or an exogenous variable (i.e., a variable that is not predicted or influenced by something in the model; "independent variable") while M and Y are mediators and outcomes, respectively. These are also known as endogenous variables (i.e., variables that are, in part, predicted or influenced by other variables in the model). These distinctions are particularly useful as the frameworks and assumptions of the models are discussed.

# Frameworks

Two highly related frameworks exist to perform mediation analysis [@Iacobucci2008book]. First, as mentioned previously, mediation analysis can be built on linear regression including ordinary least squares (OLS) and generalized linear modeling [GLM; @Hayes2009; @Hayes2013book]. This requires separate models for the $a$ paths and the $b$ and $c'$ paths, fit independently, to be combined into one mediation model. This approach is flexible in terms of the types of variables and model specifications as compared to the other---structural equation modeling (SEM). For example, performing moderated mediation is straightforward in this framework [@Hayes2013book; @Edwards2007] but more difficult in SEM. Ultimately, the regression-based framework is what this proposal builds upon.

Under the SEM paradigm, all the paths are simultaneously estimated, sometimes providing more statistical power [@Iacobucci2008book].\footnote{The idea that SEM is "superior" to the regression paradigm was refuted by Hayes (2013) by noting that in most situations differences in the estimation is extremely minor and will not alter the conclusions. This can be seen in the small effect sizes present in Iacobucci et al. (2007). Further, additional assumptions inherent in the SEM approach may not hold, although some are not easily tested (e.g., multivariate normality). With this said, SEM still provides a powerful framework for mediation analysis.} This approach notably allows more testing of the full model fit and can easily include latent variables but assumes, in general, that all variables are continuous with a multivariate normal distribution. This is a strict assumption that is difficult to assess. However, it has extensions allowing for categorical (generally ordinal) variables to be included, although this changes the estimation procedure. Issues relating to categorical mediators/outcomes are discussed in the "Analytic and Interpretation Issues with Mediation Analysis" section.

# Assumptions

In his 2008 "Introduction to Mediation Analysis" book, @mackinnon2008intro discusses the assumptions\footnote{The assumptions described herein are for both the regression and SEM frameworks for mediation, although, as noted above, SEM has a few additional assumptions as well.} of the modeling procedure. Of these primary assumptions, note that there are no major differences from the assumptions of regression analysis.

1. *Correct Functional Form*. In general, mediation assumes a linear relationship between predictors and mediators/outcomes. This can be adjusted using transformations or, more pertinently, generalized linear models (e.g., logistic regression). @mackinnon2008intro also points out that it is assumed the relationships are additive; if they are not, then the correct interactions (moderators) need to be included in the model specification. This, in many ways, needs to be driven by theory and prior literature [@Lockhart2011]. 
2. *No Omitted Influences*. A key to any mediation analysis is that variables that: 1) correlate with both the predictor and the mediator (path $a$), 2) correlate with both the mediator and the outcome (path $b$), or 3) correlate with both the predictor and the outcome (path $c'$) are included in the model. A more general form of this assumption has been termed "sequential ignorability" [@Imai2010a]. This more general form includes a sensitivity analysis to assess how important deviations from this assumption are on the conclusions [@Imai2010a; @Imai2010b].
3. *Accurate Measurement*. Random measurement error produces attenuated paths (in large sample sizes) and random bias (in small sample sizes) in regression [@Loken2017] and therefore can affect the paths in various ways (e.g., attenuate the $b$ path which can inflate the $c'$ path). When possible, reliable measures and/or proper latent variable modeling should be used for this assumption to be met.
4. *Well-Behaved Residuals*. The residuals are assumed to be random, "have constant variance at each value of the predictor variable" and "residual error terms are uncorrelated across equations" (pg. 55). The last assumption about uncorrelated errors stems from "No Omitted Influences" for, if there are omitted variables in both equations, the error terms will correlate. This is one of the few assumptions that can be assessed in most situations.

With the addition of *temporal precedence* (predictor comes before mediator) and *appropriate measurement timing* (the mediator is measured at the appropriate time when the effect of the predictor has occurred), the resulting estimates are asymptotically (i.e., with a large enough sample size) unbiased, allowing proper (causal) inference regarding the effects' magnitude and direction [@mackinnon2008intro]. This interpretation, to aid in reproducibility, needs to be highlighted with the associated uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals) in a meaningful metric.

## Other Considerations

### Causality

To discuss causality in mediation analysis, one should be familiar with the *counter-factual* (or sometimes referred to as potential outcomes) framework [@Hofler2005]. As @Imai2010a states: "the causal effect ... can be defined as the difference between two potential outcomes: one that would be realized [in the intervention] and the other that would be realized if [not in the intervention]," (pg. 3). In other words, the causal effect is the difference in potential outcomes depending on the predictor (e.g., an intervention). In reality, only one such outcome is observed---if individual "i" is assigned to the treatment group, we only observe the outcome from the treatment group and not from the control group. @Imai2010a continues: "Given this setup, the causal effect of the [intervention] can be defined as $Y_i(1) - Y_I(0)$. Because only either $Y_i(1)$ or $Y_I(0)$ is observable ... researchers often focus on the identification and estimation of the average causal effect." In a randomized design, this is simply $E(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0))$, or the expected value across multiple individuals and/or observations.

The counter-factual framework helps clarify causality in mediation analysis by defining necessary conditions thereof. Using this framework, @Imai2010b demonstrated that the assumption (discussed briefly above) of *sequential ignorability* is required for a causal interpretation in mediation analysis. That is, the assumption of "no omitted influences" mentioned earlier is particularly difficult---and important---regarding the mediator's effect on the outcome (path $b$). Because of this difficulty, and a lack of a way to test this assumption, @Imai2010a developed a general mediation model that allows a researcher to assess how strongly, via sensitivity analysis, this assumption holds.

The present project resides intuitively within this counter-factual framework. Because of its importance, this will be discussed more in the next chapter.

### Modeling Mediation
@Shrout2002 highlight a number of other important considerations in mediation analysis. First, multi-collinearity can produce problems, especially when it occurs between predictors and mediators. It can distort the statistical power of the analysis, potentially producing misleading results. The second consideration is suppression: "Suppression occurs when the indirect effect $a \times b$ has the opposite sign of the direct effect," (pg. 430). This can, if not interpreted correctly, produce confusing estimates (e.g., a positive indirect path and a negative direct path). Finally, @Shrout2002 recommend using bootstrapping [also @Hayes2009; @Hayes2013book] to understand the variability in the estimates. This is due to the asymmetric distribution of indirect effects [see Figure 6 in @Shrout2002]. Bootstrapping uses repeated random sampling of the data with replacement and estimates the model on that sampled data. Generally, between 500 and 10,000 bootstrapped samples are used to get an accurate confidence interval. Bootstrapping produces as accurate (or more accurate) Type-I error rates than other methods in mediation analysis. Because of this, bootstrapping plays a major role in this project.


## Reproducibility and Interpretability of Mediated Effects

Regardless of statistical technique used, researchers strive for reproducible and interpretable findings. First, *reproducible* suggests that the findings can be replicated (with the same or independent data). *Interpretable* findings are ones that can be easily connected to observable phenomenon, where the direction and magnitude of the findings can be intuitively understood. This has been emphasized by the American Psychological Association [@Cumming2014] and the American Statistical Association [@Wasserstein2016]. Among the most accepted recommendations include the use of effect sizes and confidence intervals. Notably, however, the estimates should be in meaningful units [i.e., units that are understood by other researchers in the field, policymakers, and others depending on the target audience; @Preacher2011].

These two elements--reproducibility and interpretability--are particularly difficult when using mediation analysis for two notable reasons.

1. Only the predictors can be randomized (i.e., the mediator cannot be randomized in most situations). That is, even when the $a$ and $c'$ paths can portray an experimental manipulation, the $b$ path(s) cannot. Therefore, the need for proper covariates, interpretation, reporting, and replication is even more important in mediation analysis. David MacKinnon said it well: "It is not likely that a true mechanism can be demonstrated in one statistical analysis.... These analyses inform the next experiment that provides more information ..." [@mackinnon2008intro, pg. 67]. 
2. Interpretation is built on combining multiple estimates, and often subsequently comparing those combinations with other estimates. For example, the indirect effect is a combination of the $a$ and $b$ paths and is often compared with the $c'$ path. Therefore, if either of the $a$ or $b$ paths are in units that cannot be easily combined, the interpretation quickly becomes very difficult (see "Analytic and Interpretation Issues with Mediation Analysis" section). This is particularly true when the mediator(s) and/or outcome is non-normal.

Therefore, the conceptual model must be considered carefully in light of theory, prior literature, and proper covariates [@Lockhart2011]. Even when done properly, replication of mediated effects is important [@mackinnon2008intro]. @Iacobucci2008book also recommends (several times) to evaluate competing models and theories---thus presenting the effects and paths in light of alternative model specifications. Further, the interpretation---comprising the magnitude and direction of the effect---needs to be reported with the proper uncertainty and include information on a) bivariate correlations, b) information on all relevant paths (even non-significant ones), c) must include information on the process of variable and covariate selection, d) report standardized and unstandardized results, and e) provide de-identified data and code [if possible]. It is important to note that much of this information can be included as supplemental material. In this way, results are reported that can be combined with others in order to provide "convincing evidence of [or lack of] a mediating mechanism", [@mackinnon2008intro, pg. 67].

The second hurdle, that of interpretation, is particularly important in this project. Below, the general interpretation guidelines are discussed, followed by when these guidelines are not straightforward.

# Interpretation

In linear models, the interpretation is simple, straightforward and intuitive. The $a$ path coefficient means: "for a one unit change in X there is an associated $a$ units change in the mediator." Likewise, the $b$ path coefficient means: "for a one unit change in M there is an associated $b$ units change in the outcome, controlling for the effect of X." Finally, the $c'$ path is: "for a one unit change in X, controlling for the effect of M, there is an associated change of $c'$ units in the outcome." The indirect effect is $a \times b$; the total effect is $a \times b + c'$. 

It is important to avoid dichotomous thinking [@Cumming2014] to best understand mediated effects. That is, each element of the mediation (i.e., the indirect, the direct, and total effects and also the individual $a$, $b$, and $c'$ paths) needs to be considered without only trying to answer: "Is there a mediated effect?" Otherwise, researchers can lose sight of each element of the mediation. For example, the various $a$ paths may be important on their own (e.g., if the $a$ path effect size is small then maybe the predictor is not a beneficial place to focus an intervention even though the effect is significant). Therefore, understanding a mediated effect is best told through several avenues: the indirect, direct, and total effects; the individual paths; these effects and paths in light of covariates; among others. This suggestion is also best if those effects are in meaningful and intuitive metrics.

However, once the analysis ventures into non-normal, non-linear relationships, the interpretation becomes more difficult---particularly when it comes to the indirect and total effects. For example, if the mediator is binary, often logistic regression is used to assess the $a$ path. But that changes the $a$ path interpretation to: "for a one unit change in X, there is an associated $a$ log odds units change in the mediator." This interpretation is anything but intuitive. In general, the log odds are transformed into odds ratios, which improve the interpretation. But these units do not mix well with other units. This is detrimental to understanding the indirect and total effects as will be discussed further in the sections below.

# Analytic and Interpretation Issues with Mediation Analysis
## Categorical and Non-Normal Mediators/Outcomes

Mediation analysis is more difficult when the mediator and/or the outcome are not continuous, including binary variables (e.g., an individual either uses marijuana or not), ordinal variables (e.g., the self-reported confidence in social settings), other polytomous variables (e.g., sub-types of a disease), and count variables (e.g., number of hospital visits). These data situations are difficult because mediation analysis requires the mediators and/or outcomes to be continuous and approximately normal (to meet the assumption of well-behaved residuals). 

There are several strategies taken in the literature to address this problem. However, each makes its own set of assumptions and each contains limitations in interpretation. The variability in approaches and the subsequent interpretations make combining results across studies far more difficult---reducing the chance to concretely show relationships via meta-analyses and systematic reviews. The difficulty of these data situations are likely reducing reproducibility and interpretability for a number of reasons:

* It may be easier to ignore the assumptions that are violated when using categorical mediators and/or outcomes. Results from these analyses may not be valid.
* Different approaches produce varying assumptions and interpretations. This can be difficult for other researchers, clinicians, lawmakers, and laypersons to keep in mind, possibly leading to misunderstandings regarding results and their validity.
* Analyses with categorical outcomes are not typically well-emphasized in graduate training, even in more simple modeling techniques, not to mention more complex techniques like mediation analysis. With fewer individuals well-trained, more errors are likely in analyzing these data.
* The interpretation regarding analyses with categorical outcomes is often far less intuitive than with continuous outcomes. This can produce a higher cognitive load for both the researchers and those utilizing the study.

With this in mind, the following subsection discusses the current approaches to mediation analysis with categorical mediators and/or outcomes and the assumptions these approaches make.

## Current Approaches

> "The quest for sound methods of incorporating categorical variables is perhaps the last dilemma in mediation analysis that lacks a strong solution---it's the 'final frontier,'" [@Iacobucci2012, pg. 583].

Although there are likely other "frontiers", categorical mediators and/or outcomes provide several challenges. @Iacobucci2008book [-@Iacobucci2012] thoroughly discusses the issues of assessing categorical variables within a mediation analysis and some of the current practices along with their associated problems\footnote{For the present, only situations when a mediator or outcome is categorical is under consideration since a categorical predictor poses very few problems (Iacobucci, 2012).}. Four approaches are of note here: 1) a series of logistic regression models, 2) polychoric correlation in SEM, 3) the method suggested by @Iacobucci2012 regarding standardization, and 4) interpret each path separately. A fifth, but certainly least, is to ignore the distribution of the outcomes and purposefully misspecify the model. These are highlighted in Table \ref{tab_approaches}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Of these approaches, only the SEM approach allows any proper estimation of effect sizes. This approach was developed by @Muthen1984, which uses polychoric correlations (for ordered categorical variables) within the structural equation modeling framework. In this approach, @Muthen1984 assumes that the ordered categorical manifest variable results from a continuous latent variable, "with observed categorical data arising through a threshold step function," [@Iacobucci2012, pg. 583]. In many cases, a continuous latent variable is a reasonable assumption. For example, in a binary variable describing whether an adolescent has ever smoked marijuana, assuming a continuous latent variable comprised of the probability of smoking may adequately represent reality. This method relies on using a probit regression "to model the relationship between the observed categorical variable and the latent *normally distributed* variable," [@mackinnon2008intro, pg. 320, emphasis added] and requires large sample sizes [@Iacobucci2008book]. Using this latent-observed submodel, the probit is used as the threshold value to estimate the full model. Notably, both the assumption of a normally distributed latent variable and the requirement of large sample sizes are limitations of this approach.

The other approaches, including the series of logistic regression models and the interpretation of each path separately, do not allow any effect size estimation of indirect effects. These estimate each path well, but "the results [cannot be] put together because the resulting 'path coefficients' are not easily integrated and interpreted," (Iacobucci 2008, Chapter 5, "Solutions to the Categorical Problem", paragraph 5). The third approach, recommended by @Iacobucci2012, suggested using a new standardization solution using logistic regression output (for a categorical variable) that can combine linear and logistic models' estimates. It is built on the same idea as the Sobel test [@Sobel1982; @mackinnon2008intro] but is more flexible; for "the mechanics of testing for mediation do not [need to] change whether the variables are continuous or categorical or some mix," [@Iacobucci2012, pg. 593]. However, @MacKinnon2012 criticized this approach. Ultimately, the most fatal flaw may be that a focus on the significance (relying on Null Hypothesis Significance Testing) of the effects without regard to their effect size in meaningful terms is less reproducible and interpretable.

In the end, none of these approaches can flexibly handle categorical variables of various kinds (e.g., binary, multinomial) or other non-normal distributions (e.g., costs, counts); none can produce intuitive and meaningful effect sizes and confidence intervals across these variable types; and none can consistently combine two differing types of estimates (e.g., binary mediator with continuous outcome, count mediator with binary outcome). Although the current approaches are useful in some situations---particularly the SEM apporach---a more complete framework is needed.

# Conclusions

Mediation analysis is a powerful framework for understanding the processes by which one variable influences another. The assumptions are not much more than that of regression analysis. The interpretation, in linear models, is straightforward and simple. However, once the analysis ventures into non-normal, non-linear relationships, the interpretation becomes more difficult---particularly when it comes to the indirect and total effects.

In the end, @Iacobucci2012 is correct in saying this problem "lacks a strong solution" (pg. 583). Although important information can be obtained from the current methods, mediation analysis with categorical mediator(s) and/or outcome(s) still misses the mark on intuitive, meaningful effect sizes.

This proposal aims to alleviate these issues by integrating a post-estimation approach known as *Average Marginal Effects* (AMEs) within mediation analysis. This integration can allow simple and meaningful interpretation across variable types and combinations thus far shown to be problematic. The following chapter introduces AMEs, showing their benefit in interpretation and reporting when working with non-normal variables within generalized linear models.
