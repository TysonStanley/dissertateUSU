\doublespacing

Write your Chapter 1 in this file. Generally this chapter is the introduction. We may have several citations [@RCoreTeam; @dissertateUSU]. Go ahead and erase all the text in this chapter (and the other chapter files, as they are just trying to fill up space for the example). Just keep the `\\doublespacing` at the beginning of this document.
